 qemu-server (8.3.0) bookworm; urgency=medium
 
   * api: import working storage: improve error message
 
   * migration: drop outdated check that was introduced for PVE 7.2 to PVE 7.3
     to guard against (relatively low) fallout of the newly introduced
     cloudinit section in the VM config. This check can sometimes trigger as
     false-positive.
