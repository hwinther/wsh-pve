 pve-manager (9.0.18) trixie; urgency=medium
 
   * ui: resource tree: fix rendering of guest text when sorted by name.
 
   * ui: fix recent regression from wrongly rendering guest entries in the tag
     view.
 
   * ui: console: add a simple heuristic to detect application containers and
     show a warning for them in the console view, as the console for such
     containers is (currently) likely not fully functional.
